# Onskor Project

A WordPress-like blog app implemented in Wagtail.

# What is it

After re-implementing WordPress-like blogs over and over again in Wagtail I decided to just make this.
Feel free to use as is or copy it as a starting point. 
It's based on the Wagtail demo blog but is closer to a standard WordPress blog style. 

This is a starting point for your wagtail based blog, especially if you are migrating from Wordpress.
It's not Wordpress and it's not drop in. You are expected to add your own templates and are given on a skeleton template to start from.

## Features

- Categories and tags with views
- RSS
- Basic starter templates with pagination
- Comments
- WordPress importer
